* In this Project there is one sign up page and one login page which are created with the help of Mocker API and local storage is used for storing the data.
* The registration page and login page are integrated such that if the user successfully login into the system he will be redirected to the landing page of flipkart.
* The website is made dynamic in nature so that if the user wants to add his own product and list it in the website he can do so with the help of add button given in navbar,also the user can sort the products based on price and product category name
